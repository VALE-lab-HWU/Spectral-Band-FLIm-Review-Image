Python is used with Matplotlib. Required packages are written in the `requirements.txt` file. PyQt5 is used as backend for Matplotlib, but you may need another one. See [https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/backends.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/backends.html).
